Dear reader,  
Thank you for taking the time to view this project! I had a lot of fun attemping it and tackling the various tasks given to me.

Tasks:

1. In this project, I have chosen to build the app using React.js, MaterialUi and firebase.
2. A simple viual loader has been added when the app first loads to ensure all necessary data for rendering has been fetched to prevent failed builds
3. Not attemped due to time constraints
4. I have added the necessary styling to ensure mobile responsiveness in the cards!
5. The app has been hosted using firebase! If you would like to have access to view the firebase backend data and hosting, do drop me and email!

The app is live at https://tinvio-demo.web.app

To locally host this repo:

1. clone repo into local machine using: git clone
2. cd into folder and run following command in terminal: npm install
3. Host locally using: npm start
